        <h1>A Folding Bike for Mister Mike!</h1>

<p class="wrapper">Some of the numerous good friends of Mike are chipping in to get him a folding bike! </p>

<p class="wrapper">We're collecting donations (via Edge Collective's Paypal account) towards the bike purchase -- to donate, click below:</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p class="wrapper">Wonderful Mike -- who helps out so many people, near and far -- has been wonderfully car-free for a while now.  </p>
    
<p class="wrapper">Mike already has a bike, but a <b>folding bike</b> would enable him to extend his reach by quite a bit via train and boat (and robotic hexapod, etc.)</p>

<p class="wrapper">So: we're organizing to purchase a nice folding bike for Mike!  We're collecting donations -- which ideally would go to a local bike shop or individual.  We're hoping to get him a bike as soon as possible!
</p>

    Some examples of folding bikes we're considering: 
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Schwinn-Loop-Folding-Bike-Black/dp/B00IASZ7QG">Schwinn Loop ($430)</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ZiZZO-Folding-Shimano-Adjustable-Aluminum/dp/B09468N8XS">ZiZZO Campo ($230)</a></li>
      </ul>
</p>
